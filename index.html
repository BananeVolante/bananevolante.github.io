			<h2>A 6 months graphics programmer internship in EFICAD</h2>
			<p>
				I developed the base of a CAD application's new graphic engine, using OpenGL 4.6 and C++20.
				I was tasked to implement various features, for example displaying text or transparent materials. For each of these features, I listed the different methods available and chose one, taking into account the needs of the company, the development and maintenance complexity, the performance, the visual result... <br>
				This engine offered a massive performance boost compared to the previous one, which was written in OpenGL 1.X.
				During 4 months, I worked with another intern whom I trained and supervised.

			<h2>A 4 months internship in a laboratory in Ikoma, Japan</h2>
			<p>
				I participated in the 2023 IPIN competition. The objective was to track the position of a phone carried by a person walking in an indoor environment. 
				To perform this task, I had access to the phone's Inertial Measurement Unit (Accelerometer + Gyroscope + Magnetometer) and to around 100 Bluetooth beacons.
				Instead of relying on a state of the art solution, the objective was to find new methods.  <br>
				My tasks mainly consisted in analyzing the available data to find points that could be improved, 
				formulating possible improvements, discussing them with my tutor, implementing those improvements and evaluating their effectiveness. 
<br>
				I finished third out of eight participants.

			<h2>A 2 months internship in ADIS</h2>
			<p>
				My first internship has been carried out in ADIS, a subsidiary of AXA. During those 2 months, I developed a microservice composed of a REST API(using Java Spring Boot)
				 and a web GUI(using Vue.js). <br>
				 All the work produced adhered to a high standard in terms of code quality and testing.

				Vulkan
			</H3>
			<p>I am currently learning Vulkan. <br> I began with <a href="https://vkguide.dev/">Victor Blanco's Vulkan
					guide</a> and <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/">Alexander Overvoorde's Vulkan tutorial</a>,
				then used them as a foundation to implement various features and experiment with the possibilities
				offered by Vulkan.</p>

			<h3>A path tracer</h3>
			<p>
				During a school project, I created a CPU ray tracer then modified it and turned it into a path tracer.</p>

			<h3>OpenGL</h3>
			<p>
				I followed <a href="https://learnopengl.com">this guide</a> to learn how to use OpenGL and implemented various small features. During my 6 month internship, I had the opportunity to improve my knowledge of OpenGL and learn how to use its latest features.

			<h3>A compiler for an esoteric language</h3>
			<p>As a school project, in a group of 4, we developed a compiler for a programming language that exclusively uses binary trees. We parsed the source code using ANTLR, converted it into an Abstract Syntax Tree then into three-address code and finally into C++, which we compiled. We also implemented some code optimization techniques.</p>
