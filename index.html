			<h2>A 6 months graphics programmer internship in EFICAD</h2>
			<p>
				Development of a base for a CAD application’s new graphic engine in OpenGL 4.6 and C++20. Includes a
				scene graph, a programming interface useable by a general programmer, support for transparency and text,
				a massive increase in performance, notably when displaying long trajectories, controls using a 3D mouse.

				Vulkan
			</H3>
			<p>I am currently learning Vulkan. <br> I started with <a href="https://vkguide.dev/">Victor Blanco's Vulkan
					guide</a> and <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/">Alexander Overvoorde's Vulkan tutorial</a>,
				then used the tutorials as a base to implement various features and experiment with the possibilities
				offered by Vulkan.</p>

			<h3>A path tracer</h3>
			<p>
				During a school project, we created a CPU ray tracer. I modified it and turned it into a path tracer.</p>

			<h3>OpenGL</h3>
			<p>
				I followed <a href="https://learnopengl.com">this guide</a> to learn how to use OpenGL and implemented various small features. During my 6 month internship, I had the occasion to improve my knowledge of OpenGL and learn how to use its latest features.

			<h3>A compiler for an esoteric language</h3>
			<p>As a school project, in a group of 4, we developed a compiler for a programming language that only uses binary trees. We parsed the source code using ANTLR, turned it into an Abstract Syntax Tree, then into three-address code and finally into C++, that we compiled. Some code optimization techniques have been implemented.</p>
